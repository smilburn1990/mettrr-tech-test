# What we want you to do

> Welcome...

> First of all I want you to create a branch from master with the naming convention - "{your name}/mettrr-tech-test".

> Here at Mettrr, we use the airbnb linter on our code base to ensure that we have consistency and good structure in all out JS files. Your first task is to start up the dev server and fix the issues, preventing you from development.

> The next task is to create a component called countryList and apply it to the route "/country-list".

> Once you have the component set up, use "axios" to retrieve the data from this endpoint - https://api.myjson.com/bins/16i597 (we will look closely at file structure and seperation on concerns).

> Now I want you to create a styled drop down for the list of country names, excluding any of them on the "no fly list" (testing your research skill). Remember that due to the size of the list, the UX might be a little bit rubbish, so we want to see how you would handle this from a design perspective.

> Once you are done, you can push your changes to your branch and create a pull request to master, tagging @smilburn1990 in it and followed by an email to myself (email above) to confirm your completion.

> Good luck :)
